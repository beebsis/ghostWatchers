                            Welcome fellow Hunter! To weaken and capture the ghost, you will need to discover what type of ghost you are dealing with, the age of the ghost and it's mood. To determine these three things you will be using the tools found in your van. 
    
                            To see and log any evidence found on your hunt, use the <code>TAB</code> key. Here you will see on the right hand side the Type of current ghosts, the age and mood along with a currently greyed out “Weaken The Ghost button” (more on that later) and the Encyclopaedia for more information. 
                            On the left side you will see Thermometer, EMF and Footprints for the Type of ghost you are dealing with. Particle Counter and Ouija Board for Ghost Age. Radio and Voodoo Doll for mood.
                            Once you have determined the type, age and mood of the ghost, the “Weaken the Ghost button” will become available. This button will give you a list of actions you must perform in the right order to weaken the ghost enough to capture it. You will also see what objects or actions will protect you, protect but irritate the ghost and what will provide no protection at all. After a successful step is taken towards weakening the ghost, a sound cue will be played <code>(in normal difficulty, also text on the screen to confirm weakening the ghost)</code>. If you follow the secuence listed and do not hear the sound cue, it is possible you either are hunting the wrong age and/or mood of the ghost (type can be confirmed by model). It is also possible that the next step was already fulfilled and you have progressed further (all Taps are off for example). Use your best judgment on what to do from that point, experiment if needed. 
    
    
                            You will also have a list of objectives to do on the board in the van to gain some extra cash. After completing the objective, a sound cue will be played and the money will be added to your funds.
                            Any money gathered before and during the session can be used for that session (does not carry to the next round) at the laptop in the van. Items will be delivered right after purchase in the tray to the left of the laptop.

                <h3>How to catch a ghost</h3>
                <p>
                    
                    If you press TAB, you'll open a pad where you'll see different properties.<br>
                    On the left you have evidences that'll determine which ghost you're hunting.<br>
                    On the right side, you'll be removing options as you find evidence along the way<br>
                    Once you've selected most of the evidence, it starts to shrink down to one or two ghosts.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>Scenario:<br>
                    If we get Thermometer, 47. Then we have a Demon or a Vampire.<br>
                    We're getting a particle counter response of 500-1000, the age is now either senior or ancient.<br>
                    Now let's try the Ouija board, seems like it's moving from side to side. The ghost is a senior.<br>
                    What about the radio? It looks like we have growling. The ghost is either aggressive or hunting.<br>
                    Hmm, we have the Voodoo doll and the EMF left. Let's try the EMF, we're getting RED3. This is a demon!<br>
                    Voodoo doll left, the ghost doesn't interact so it's an aggressive ghost.<br><br>
                </p>
                

                <p>
                    After we have found all the evidence, we can now use the "weakening the ghost" button in the pad<br>
                    and with that figure out the steps we need to take one by one in order to capture it.<br>
                    These Steps must be followed! If you fail one or skip one, then you wont progress.<br>
                    In the end the ghost will show itself constantly and you'll be able to throw the Ghost Catcher at it.
                </p>

                    <br>
                    So.<br>
                    Step 1: Figure out the ghost evidence<br>
                    Step 2: Weakening the Ghost<br>
                    Step 3: Catch the ghost
