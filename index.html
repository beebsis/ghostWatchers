                                    <ul>
                                        The process of haunt consists of 3 stages:
                                        <li>Determine the special properties of the ghost</li>
                                        <li>Perform the right weakening ritual</li>
                                        <li>Catch a ghost using special trap</li>
                                    </ul>

                        To collect evidence and read hints, use <code>TAB</code>. You will see a pad, in the left part of which you need to indicate the collected evidence. In the right part you need to select the correct properties of the ghost. The selected evidence from the left part will help to select the propreties in the right part. There are two buttons at the bottom of the pad:
                        Encyclopedia. This section contains descriptions of all the ghosts and tools
                        Weakening the ghost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section provides a list of actions to weaken the ghost. In the right part there is a hint on the action of the tools on the selected type of ghost
                        Each correct action to weaken the ghost will be accompanied by the <code>sound of a gong</code> and a <code>hint (at an normal difficulty level)</code>. If you perform actions in the correct sequence, but do not see these effects - most likely, you made a mistake with the properties of the ghost. Check it again!
                        There are also some additional quests that gives you coins. Coins can be immediately spent on the purchase of tools. Purchased tools are not transferred to the next session.

                    <p>You need to complete all the tasks from the weakening list in the correct order.</p>
                    <p>If you have done 3 tasks correctly, but the 4th one is wrong, you do not need to start from the beginning.</p>
                    <p>At a normal level of difficulty, you can understand that the correct action has been done by the message that appears at the top of the screen and the special sound.</p>
                    <p>If you have done all the actions correctly, then the ghost will walk around the house in a visible state. Throw the catcher at the ghost.</p>
